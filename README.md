# **Factorial Feature**

The Factorial Feature program, a test-driven developed program, computes the factorial of a number. This program is a [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript-unit-testing) project intended to enhance my skills on the use of test-driven development with Mocha.

## Project Prompt

In this project, you will use test-driven development to build a factorial method. You will use the assert module and mocha testing library to drive your development using tests that follow the phases: setup, exercise, and verification.

## Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6)

## Setup

You need install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to your machine.

The program needs the necessary dependencies first in order for the program to run as intended. In the terminal, enter this command:

```bash
npm install mocha -D
```

To run the test program, input this command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Sources

The techniques utilized was based on the lessons taught in [Codecademy's Learn JavaScript Unit Testing Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript-unit-testing). The challenge is also provided by Codecademy.
